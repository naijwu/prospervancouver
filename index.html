									<h1>Prosper Vancouver</h1>
									<h2>06.02.18 | Sauder School of Business</h2>
									<p>
										Greetings,<br><br>
										Our names are Dania Shaeeb and Jeffrey Guo and we have the great honour of serving as your chairs for Prosper Vancouver 2018. When we first leaped into the world of business conferences and competitions, we couldn't imagine the doors that business would open for us. Throughout the years, we have had so many opportunities to explore and develop our passion in business, and now we wish to inspire others to pursue the same. These conferences have helped us come out of our shell only to be greeted by the kindest people We ever met. These people, who we delighted to call our best friends, have nurtured us and helped us grow into a strong, hard working, and ambitious people who will go above and beyond to make Prosper Vancouver one of the best business conferences in the Lower Mainland.
										<br><br>
										When we started out as a young participants and competitors in various businesses conferences, there was no doubt that we felt nervous and somewhat confused. After attending our first ever conference, however, we came out feeling more confident and determined than ever. Everyone was understanding and caring, guiding me throughout the entire course. We quickly adapted to the rhythm of the conference and had made some of my best memories there. At Prosper, our team strives to do the same for all participants, old and new. We want to make this a welcoming and fun experience where all participants regardless of experience are able to grow, connect with one another, and make lasting memories for a lifetime.
										<br><br>
										The Prosper Vancouver 2018 team can't wait to meet all of you; we'll be waiting for you at the doors. Good luck to everyone and we hope to see everyone in June!
										<br><br>
										Sincerely,<br>
										Jeffrey Guo & Dania Shaeeb | Co-Chairs

				    			A grade 11 student at Fraser Heights Secondary, Kevin is ecstatic to be Director of Logistics for Prosper 2018. His penchant for economics and corporate matters has sparked his lovefor the buzzing atmosphere at case competitions: he has longed for a time where his attention to global business news networks would play a rather practical role. When Kevin is not cramming for math or procrastinating at the very last minute, he can be found exporing Vancouver's culinary scene, binge watching his favourite shows, partaking in Model UN or debate, and occasionally even on the badminton court. Kevin hopes that Prosper's first iteration will bring together passionate youth to bond over a memorable day of intense discussion and critical thinking!
